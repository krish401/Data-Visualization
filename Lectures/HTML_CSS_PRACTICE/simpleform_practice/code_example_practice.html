    <h4>Course Objectives</h4>
    <p>In this course we will learn how the internet works and how we can create webpages. We will use <b>HTML, CSS</b> and basic <b>JavaScript</b> in this course for designing the webpages. <u>As we might have students in this course with no previous programming experience, therefore, the pace of the course is designed for beginners</u>. We will not go into any server side scripting and the class discussions will be limited to the client side programming. Assignments will augment the class lectures. <u>To ensure the development of the necessary competencies, assigned <i><b>homework</b></i> includes the development of program solutions to problems of adequate complexity and relevance.</u> <p>
